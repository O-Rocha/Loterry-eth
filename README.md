## Solidity Lottery Contract

The objective of this repo is to explore secure development of solidity contracts for Etherum. The inicial contract uploaded to this repo contains a lot o security flaws and should not be deployed as a real contract. As I learn more about security best practices the quality of the code should improve.

Any other texts such as articles are very welcome. Feel free to make a pull request with new references, the objective is for us to learn togheter and document the process.

# TODO
* Create tests for the contract
* Find a way to generate a "random" number securely
* Evaluate the security risks and patch them
